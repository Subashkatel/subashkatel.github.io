            <p>I am a final-year Computer Science student at UCSD. Currently, I am applying to graduate school to explore my passion for compilers, machine learning, and heterogeneous systems.</p>

            <p>My research interests focus on leveraging compilers and machine learning techniques to optimize heterogeneous systems for high-performance computing environments. I have had the chance contribute to developing compiler tools and techniques that bridge the gap between high-level machine learning models and hardware-specific optimizations.</p>

            <p>In addition to my work in computer science, I have had chance to contribute in high-energy physics, applying self-supervised learning methods to analyze particle jet data. My physics research, under the mentorship of Prof. Javier Duarte, led to the development of the Jet-based Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (J-JEPA), a framework for learning augmentation-independent representations of jets. Still on the works üòâ</p>

            <p>I have had the privilege of being mentored by amazing faculty at UCSD, including Prof. Javier Duarte and Prof. Hadi Esmaeilzadeh.</p>
